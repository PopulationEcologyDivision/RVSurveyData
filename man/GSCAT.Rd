\item{MISSION}{A 10 character field to identify the survey.Â  The first 3 character identifies the vessel (eg. NED), the next 4 characters identifies the year (eg. 2000) and the last 3 characters identifies the survey number within the year. (eg. 001). Example NED2000001.}
\item{SETNO}{Each tow is assigned a numeric set identifier starting with 1 for the first tow and then assigned consecutively.}
\item{SPEC}{Maritimes species code.}
\item{TOTWGT}{Total Weight (Kg), standardized for a 1.75NM tow. When a trawl is hauled, all of the individuals for a given species are weighed and counted. These values become TOTWGT and TOTNO in GSCAT. }
\item{TOTNO}{Total Number, standardized for a 1.75NM tow. When a trawl is hauled, all of the individuals for a given species are weighed and counted. These values become TOTWGT and TOTNO in GSCAT. TOTNO is sometimes calculated from the weight.}
\item{TOTWGT_RAW}{Total Weight (Kg), raw data. When a trawl is hauled, all of the individuals for a given species are weighed and counted. These values become TOTWGT and TOTNO in GSCAT.}
\item{TOTNO_RAW}{Total Number, raw data. When a trawl is hauled, all of the individuals for a given species are weighed and counted. These values become TOTWGT and TOTNO in GSCAT. TOTNO is sometimes calculated from the weight.}
