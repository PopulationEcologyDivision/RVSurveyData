\item{SETNO}{Each tow is assigned a numeric set identifier starting with 1 for the first tow and then assigned consecutively.}
\item{SPEC}{Maritimes species code.}
\item{TOTWGT}{Total Weight (Kg). When a trawl is hauled, all of the individuals for a given species are weighed and counted.  These values become  TOTWGT and TOTNO in GSCAT.  For huge catches, the TOTNO is sometimes calculated from the weight.}
